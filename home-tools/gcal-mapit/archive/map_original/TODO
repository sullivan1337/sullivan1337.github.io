What is the 'src' directory (ask Chad)?

Remove external calls 
  $.getJSON("http://chadnorwood.com/saveJson/?callback=?", {sj: cnMF.reportData}); 


[DONE] Write a feature list. See http://chadnorwood.com/projects/gcm/#KeyFeatures

[DONE] What happens when the list of events is too long? See vert slider in 
   http://chadnorwood.com/gcm/?u=http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/jo0ubvoi1gutr95kdtl1245u3g@group.calendar.google.com/public/basic

[DONE] remove PHP code. See index.html

[DONE] Create test calendar.  
	https://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/0ei0284so407vu24o7o0q5ares%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic

[DONE] non-ascii characters break the geo-locating code. Removed encode(), use instead http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_encodeuri.asp

[TRIVIAL] Change dates has a debug popup that should be removed

[TRIVIAL] Add link to FAQ in information message: "The Following Events Had Addresses (Where) That Could Not Be Found. See FAQ" 
	See FAQ.html for a start. 

[EASY] Remove the "_ errors" in the top right box. It's redundant with the warning link that appears. 

[EASY] When events are on the whole day, do not display time (second part of 2011-12-10 Sat 00:00)

[EASY] Jump to an address, city, or zip - the zoom level should match the granularity: "Indiana" is a state-wide request. 

[MEDIUM] Inform the user of inconsistencies (in the calendar entries). Use a javascript alert?

[MEDIUM] plot icon on the map should bear information. For example, number of events at location. 

[MEDIUM] Display several calendars at once: differentiate by color

[MEDIUM] Inform the user for time-consuming operations (load calendar)

[BUG] horizontal time slider filters OK the calendar table, but not the map (look for first chronolgical entry)

[TEDIOUS] Translate application (add flags under the top right GCM logo; auto-detect language by IP)

[???] Write an integration process: checkSyntax, minify, push to Web server

**Instructions**:
1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
1. Mix Karo® Light Corn Syrup(or syrup mixture and flour), eggs, sugar, butter and vanilla using a spoon or a rubber spatula. Stir in pecans and pour the mixture into pie crust.
1. Bake on center rack of oven for 60 to 70 minutes. Cool for at least 2 hours on wire rack before serving.

**Notes**:
- If you are using a prepared frozen pie crust, place cookie sheet in oven and preheat oven as directed. Pour filling into frozen crust and bake on preheated cookie sheet.
